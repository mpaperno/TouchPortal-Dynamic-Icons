# What Is This?

Do you find the need to render out a bar graph, or round gauge in Touch Portal, or some complex layered image like a flight altimeter, or flight level guage, thermometer, but it it needs to be dynamic. Look no further, this plugin can do that for you.
This will draw bar graphs, or round gauges, or more complex layered images with different transformations based on your configured actions, colors, etc. (see Actions section for info), see Sample section for what you can do with it.
